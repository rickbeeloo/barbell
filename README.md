# Barbell Demultiplexer

## Overview
Barbell demultiplexer uses a [custom semi-global aligner](https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/astar-pairwise-aligner) designed to accurately identify barcodes, even in read ends where semi-global constraints typically introduce artificial edits. Barbell operates with fewer parameters and is optimized to detect as much contamination as possible.

The process begins by generating edit distances for every position in the read. Minima are then selected from these distances and backtraced to obtain full alignments. All obtained alignments compete for the same read region, with the best alignment ultimately being selected.

Barbell's focus extends beyond barcode identification to include flanking sequences such as adapters. In cases where concatenated barcodes are nearly undetectable, these flanking sequences may still be present. Identifying such cases is crucial to prevent misannotations downstream.

## Installation

To install Barbell Demultiplexer, clone the repository and build it using Cargo:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:rickbeeloo/barbell-sg.git
cd barbell-sg

# Build the project
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' cargo build --release
```

Note, we use compile flags (`RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native'`) to target the native architecture as the aligner uses [SIMD instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD).

## Quickstart
Inside the folder `target/release/`:
```
./barbell annotate -i input.fastq -o output.txt -q queries.fasta -t 8 --tune
```

## Usage

### Annotate FASTQ Files
To annotate a FASTQ file with barcode information, use the `annotate` command:
Note, the executable is in `./target/release/`

```sh
./barbell annotate -i input.fastq -o output.txt -q queries.fasta -t 8 --tune
```

**Options:**
- `-i, --input` (required): Input FASTQ file
- `-o, --output` (required): Output file path
- `-q, --queries` (required): Query files (comma-separated paths)
- `-t, --threads` (optional): Number of threads (default: 5)
- `--tune` (optional): Enable autotuning

It's recommended to use the `--tune` flag to find the best parameter for your input queries unless you already have a good estimamte. This is simply the fraction of the input sequence which is allowed to be mutated. Generally two random sequences have an edit distance of 0.5, so this cut off should be below that, by default `0.35`.

You can provide multiple query files, so for example if you have a dual-end barcode experiment you can provide `left.fasta` and `right.fasta`, which will  be prefixed wiht `L` and `R` respectively in the output. An example query file, for rapid barcoding can be found in [examples/rapid_barcodes.fasta](examples/rapid_barcodes.fasta).

## Features

### Plot Results
(Not implemented yet)

```sh
./barbell plot
```

## Example Output
The output file will have the following format:
```sh

With the read identifier (`read`), followed by the `label` - the most important column. It will have the sequence identifiers from your input file with as suffix `#F_rw`, `#F_rc`, `#R_fw` and `#R_rc` for forward, forward rc, reverse and reverse rc matches respectively. It's always smart to take a look at the file to understand what was matched, and in what orientation and whether this is what you expect. The label column can also contain `Flank` this indicates that no barcode was good enough to be aligned but that the flank was still clearly present. The `edits` is the number of edits compared to the query. The `dist.to.end` is the distance to the end of the read which is positive when closer to the left end of the read and negative when closer to the right end. This makes it easy to filter later on for example saying your barcodes should be at least 250bp away from the read ends. The read length column is the length of the read.
