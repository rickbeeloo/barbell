# Barbell - a new perspective on demultiplexing

### Why barbell?
- More accurate barcode scoring scheme, around **5x less 
barcode bleeding** than Dorado
- Over **100x less trimming errors** compared to Dorado
- Equivalent, or **better assemblies**
- **Contamination free** assemblie by removing artefact reads
- Easily applicable to **custom experiments**
- Still **very fast**

## Installing Barbell
Barbell is written in Rust

#### Install Rust
Check if you have Rust installed, run `rustc --version`, if no output you should install Rust:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Important note
**Note**: requires **AVX2 and BMI2** as these are used
in [sassy](https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/sassy). It is therefore unlikely to work on Apple Silicon or ARM-based systems, and may also fail on older CPUs. <u>Most modern x86_64 Ubuntu systems should work, depending on the CPU</u>.

### From releases (when public)
see [releases](https://github.com/rickbeeloo/barbell/releases), for example:
```bash
wget https://github.com/rickbeeloo/barbell-sg/releases/download/v0.1.8/barbell-sassy-rewrite-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz

```

### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rickbeeloo/barbell-sg
cd barbell-sg
cargo build --release
```


The `barbell` executable is now in `/target/release` 


## Quickstart
Most Nanopore kits (except those for RNA and Twist) were added to the `kit` command and can be ran without 
much manual interference: (if you have a custom kit [jump here[(#)]). 
While these "presets" help you to quickly analyze data and get a feel of barbell we highly recommend 
going through the "Understanding Barbell" section as you will likely get much more from your reads 
by understand them. 

```bash
barbell kit -k <kit-name> -i <reads.fastq> -o <output_folder> --maximize
```
The `--maximize` option is generally recommended (e.g. for assembly) unless you really want the near perfect barcode configuration. 

### Native barcoding example (SQK-NBD114-96)
```bash
barbell kit -k SQK-NBD114-96 -i <reads.fastq> -o <output_folder> --maximize
```
This use our lower bound edit distance formula to set a cut-off for the sequences flanking the barocde. 
This is generally quite strict but works well for good sequence quality. If you notice a lot of reads are missed during the annotate step you could try to lower it to for example `--flank-max-errors 6`, but make sure you again check the inspect output to see if you are not creating too many "Fflank" matches which likely indicate random matches. 

### Rapid barcoding example (SQK-RBK114-96)
```bash
barbell kit -k SQK-RBK114-96 -i <reads.fastq> -o <output_folder> --maximize
```
The currently supported kits can be found [here[(data/supported_kits.txt)]


## Understanding Barbell
While presets are ideal for a quick analysis, going through each of the invidiual steps of barbell can show valuable insights in your experimental setup, where
things went wrong, how to get more reads, are things glued together? etc. 
First we go over the basic steps of barbell:
1. **Annotate**: Finding barcodes and their flanks in the reads. With "flanks" we mean sequencing flanking the barcodes are specified in the [Nanopore chemistry doc](https://nanoporetech.com/document/chemistry-technical-document#barcode-sequences). The scoring is mainly based on two falues:
- `--flank-max-errors`: maximum number of edits allowed in the (combined) flanking sequences, so excluding the barocde. This is automatically, but conservertialy. determined based on the flank length. If you want to increase the number of reads look at the auto threshold and slightly increase this. 
`--min-score` and `--min-score-diff`, these by default are `0.5` and `0.05` respectively which are generally fine. We use a custom scoring here (see paper) that focus on tighly packed "match" streaks instead of just edits alone. To be "strict" you would be around 0.5 and 0.6, to get more reads at the risk of making mistakes would be around 0.2-0.4. For the `--min-score-diff` you would generally not change that.
